# NWNHotkeys-V2

Welcome to NWNHotkeys-V2, in this project I will be trying to recreate my AutoHotkey tool for Neverwinter Nights, that helps to simplify buying multiples of items from shops in game at a quicker pace than would be achievable manually.

for the original project and possibly more information as to the tools function please refer to the original repository at https://github.com/DrowArrow/NWNHotkeys

# Current Progress

As it stands, currently a very simple version of the script is functional (NWNHotkeys.py) and the next step is to attempt to only have it function if the game window is in focus (NWNHotkeys-restrict-function-to-window.py) this currently isn't functional, and is very much a work in progress as i learn python through trial and error.
